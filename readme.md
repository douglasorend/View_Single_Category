## Introduction
This Mod Adds the Ability to view all boards in a single category.
When you are on BoardIndex Clicking CatName will allow you to view that Category. Collapsible Categories are still usable via the Link image to the left of Catname.
As well when you are viewing a board clicking the Category name will bring up the boards in the Category.
Multiple Categories are supported with a comma separated array.

## Admin Settings
There are no admin settings.  To disable it, you must remove this mod.

## Compatibility Notes
